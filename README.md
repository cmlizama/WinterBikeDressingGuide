Simple web app that takes in a temperature condition and returns a suggested biking outfit

It would use a 3rd party API to take in weather data and would return a suggested outfit.

User would have the option of alternatively suggesting warmer or colder outfit depending on their preference.

Could also perhaps integrate amazon.com api or REI.com to suggest where to find an item of clothing they do not own.

Stores an object of clothing values that are tied to winter weather keys.
