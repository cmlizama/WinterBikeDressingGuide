README.md

-Simple 1-2 page web app that takes in a temperature condition and returns a suggested biking outfit

-It would use a 3rd party API to take in weather data and would use the weather info to find corresponding data in the database.

-User would have the option of alternatively suggesting warmer or colder outfit depending on their preference.

-Could also perhaps integrate amazon.com api or REI.com to suggest where to find an item of clothing they do not own

-Possibly a collection for each body part, i.e. what to wear on your head, your feet, etc etc

-Of course it would also probably need a disclaimer saying that the user should use the app as a rough guideline and always exercise their best judgment when biking in the cold.

-Inspired by sites like logicalincrements.com, whatthefuckshouldimakefordinner.com, and the biking weather charts myself and other Minnesota cyclists often make for themselves.

-Perhaps with a user login system visitors can also make custom profiles to store their own clothing preferences.
